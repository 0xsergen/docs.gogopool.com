# Using the Alpha Testnet

To test our product, we needed total control over the staking reward timings. Our testnet has a reward payout period of 2 minutes, with a flat rate of 10% rewards. This allows our testers to quickly get feedback on their testnet nodes.&#x20;

### Creating A Wallet

See [here](wallet-configuration.md).

### Adding our Tokens

First, navigate to our [welcome page](https://app.gogopool.com/alphaWelcome) and connect your wallet. Only Metamask is supported in our Alpha.

Next, click the "Add GGP Token" and "Add ggAVAX" to add the respective tokens to your wallet!

### Getting Funds

Head over to the [faucet](https://anr-ggp-faucet.fly.dev/) and switch the network to "Avalanche Node Runner".

### Getting a Node ID

During our testnet alpha we will not be supporting the creation of additional nodes. However, you can borrow on of our nodes temporarily so you can test out our Dashboard and the Minipool Creation process. To get a node ID, head over to the [Welcome Page](https://app.gogopool.com/alphaWelcome) and copy the Node ID!

From here, the [Create Minipool](https://app.gogopool.com/nodeOperator) page will guide you through the process of creating a minipool! Before you head over there, make sure you have at least 100 GGP and 1000 AVAX in your wallet! If not head over to the [faucet](https://anr-ggp-faucet.fly.dev/)!
