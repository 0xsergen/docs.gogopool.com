# Using the Alpha Testnet

To test our product, we needed total control over the staking reward timings. Our testnet has a reward payout period of 2 minutes, with a flat rate of 10% rewards. This allows our testers to quickly get feedback on their testnet nodes.&#x20;

### Creating A Wallet

See [here](wallet-configuration.md).

### Adding our Tokens

First, navigate to our [welcome page](https://app.gogopool.com/alphaWelcome) and connect your wallet. Only Metamask is supported in our Alpha.
