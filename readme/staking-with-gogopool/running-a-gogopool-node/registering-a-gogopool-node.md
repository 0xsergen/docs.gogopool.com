description: How to stake AVAX on the GoGoPool protocol!

# Registering a GoGoPool Node

Navigate to our [node registration page](https://app.gogopool.com/nodeOperator). Connect your wallet with the funds you want to stake and select your appropriate network (for our alpha tests, this would be GGP ANR).

Once you have an appropriate amount of funds, (for our alpha you need 1001 AVAX and 200 GGP token). If you lack the correct token amount on our testnet or Fuji, head over to the [faucets](../liquid-staking.md#adding-funds-on-testnets).

Then enter your node's ID in the form below!

After you've registered your node ID, you have to approve and stake your GGP tokens. The minimum GGP tokens to stake is 100 GGP when depositing 1000 AVAX. If you don't have any GGP on either our testnet or fuji, head over to [the faucet](https://anr-ggp-faucet.fly.dev/) and get some!

After the GGP is approved, you now enter your AVAX staking amount and duration! On our testnet, staking duration is set at 15 minutes, and on the Fuji testnet it is statically set to 2 weeks, so this cannot be changed. In the future on the Avalanche mainnet, there will be more options for duration.

After accepting the transaction, you will be staking in no time!

Now you just wait on our oracles to accept and start staking for you! This process can take a few hours, so be patient! Once its done, you'll be able to see your rewards on our Node Dashboard (coming soon) and in your wallet!
