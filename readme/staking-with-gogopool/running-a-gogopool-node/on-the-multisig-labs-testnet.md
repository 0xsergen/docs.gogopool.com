# On the Multisig Labs Testnet

Make sure you [added our network to Metamask](../../wallet-configuration.md#multisig-labs-testnet-settings).

First obtain a Testnet Node ID from our [Alpha Welcome page](https://www.gogopool.com/alphaWelcome).

Once that's been complete, head over to our [Node Registration Page](https://app.gogopool.com/nodeOperator) and follow along [in the docs](registering-a-gogopool-node.md)!
