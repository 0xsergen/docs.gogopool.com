# Liquid Staking

The process of liquid staking on all networks (Our private testnet, Fuji, and Mainnet) is identical! Before continuing, identify which network you want to test out liquid staking on.

## Adding Funds on Testnets

If you are testing out GoGoPool on our private testnet, head over to [our faucet](https://anr-ggp-faucet.fly.dev/) and add some funds!

If you are testing out GoGoPool on Fuji, head over to the [official faucet](https://faucet.avax.network/) and add some funds!
