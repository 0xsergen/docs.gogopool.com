# As a Node Operator

## How to make a Minipool

A Minipool is a term we borrowed from RocketPool. It represents a validator that was funded via AVAX contributed from liquid stakers using the deposit pool and AVAX contributed from node operators during their registration with GoGoPool.

Currently, we offer two different experiences to create Minipools. Our original experience, which we call Manual Setup, and our new one-click launcher experience, Minipools 2.0.
