# One-Click Launcher

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/1Fmm88kQADE" %}

In our one-click launch experience, you only need AVAX to launch your minipool. We have partnered with [ooNodz.network](https://oonodz.network/) to instantly spin up an avalanche node when you launch your minipool. We have handled buying and staking ggp on your behalf, with the collateralization ratio starting between 10-11%. If you want to use your existing GGP holdings, you can add to this collateralization ratio after your minipool is created, on your [Dashboard](https://app.gogopool.com/dashboard/).

To test GoGoPool on Fuji, use our [faucet](https://anr-ggp-faucet.fly.dev/) to get test GGP.

{% hint style="info" %}
The visuals for each setup below show how to create a Minipool on Fuji. The steps are the same as on Mainnet, but the AVAX and GGP requirements are different.
