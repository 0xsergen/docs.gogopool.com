# As a Node Operator

## Creating a Fuji or Mainnet node

To use GoGoPool as a node operator, and earn rewards on your staked GGP, you have to have an Avalanche node. To create a node, see the [Official Avalanche guides](https://docs.avax.network/nodes). Once you have a NodeId, come back to gogopool to register as a validator.

## How to make a Minipool

A minipool is a term we borrowed from RocketPool. It represents a validator that was funded via AVAX contributed from liquid stakers via the deposit pool and AVAX contributed from node operators during their registration with GoGoPool.

Steps and visuals coming soon.
