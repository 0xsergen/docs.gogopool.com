# GoGoPool's Mission

### Subnets have 3 barriers to massive adoption: financial, technical, and community.

The GoGoPool protocol immediately solves the **financial** barrier for subnets with a liquid staking protocol. Our team is actively working on tackling the others.

Our mission is to simplify developing, launching, and managing a Subnet to such an extent that it becomes effortless.

We are committed to making the Subnet ecosystem accessible to all, and we firmly believe that Subnets should be the primary choice for launching new appchains.
