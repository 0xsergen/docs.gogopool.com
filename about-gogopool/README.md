## Overview

GoGoPool is a permissionless staking protocol built for Avalance Subnets.

GoGoPool enables node operators to launch new Avalanche validator nodes for 1000 AVAX by using the GGP token, and maximizes their yield and freedom.

For stakers, GoGoPool offers a way to stake any amount of AVAX and earn real yield in a safe way through liquid staking.

## Mission

Our mission is to make developing, launching and managing a Subnet as easy as possible in order to reach the Wordpress moment for web3.

If you believe Subnets should be the default option for launching new appchains, join the discussion on the GoGoPool Community Discord. We look forward to working with you!
