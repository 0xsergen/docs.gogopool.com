# GoGoPool Primer

## A Permissionless Staking Protocol For Avalanche Subnets.

## **TL;DR**

1. Subnets are Avalanche’s main scaling mechanism, but aren’t realistic right now because of the cost and limitations of staking
2. Liquid staking is just a small part of the problem, and everyone is focused on that (leaving builders out to dry)
3. GoGoPool solves the entire problem with a permissionless staking protocol combining liquid staking, decentralized hardware, and subnet compatibility. These three elements work together to trivialize the cost of staking + validating -- powering the growth of subnets, and the future of Avalanche

## **The Subnet Vision**

[Avalanche](https://www.avax.network/) promises to be a fast, low cost and eco friendly blockchain - thanks to **subnets.** Subnets let anyone build a blockchain without having to worry about its infrastructure, getting Avalanche’s best features for free.

As a single example: DeFi Kingdoms (the most popular blockchain game, lives on Harmony network) wants to launch an expansion to their game, but launching on Harmony is going to be expensive and slow for their users and they need more customization. They are launching a subnet on Avalanche, taking advantage of fast transaction times and with their own dedicated set of validators - leading to a fast and cheap experience for their users. Launching via subnets also lets DFK to experiment with tokenomics — tying the tokenomic of their blockchain directly to game mechanics.

Basically, subnets power the explosive growth of Avalanche by allowing infinite horizontal scaling and rapid experimentation with new models and ideas.

But in reality, subnets are expensive to start, grow and manage. Right now, they are held back by the cost and limitations of staking.

Ideally, every subnet should have a one-click launch and grow experience and not have to worry about their validators because the cost of staking is so low.

A handful of projects are focused on **liquid staking** as a way to lower the cost of staking on Avalanche, but they are focused on a small part of the problem. Having liquid staking will definitely help the ecosystem grow by providing liquidity, but does not lower the cost of validation for subnets. Entrepreneurs remain locked out of the next generation of opportunities, and Avalanche misses out on its next step function of growth.

We’re doing the hard thing, and building a permissionless staking protocol that has:

1. Decentralized hardware pools
2. Liquid staking
3. Subnet compatibility

Hardware operators join the protocol with 1000 AVAX, get matched with funds from liquid stakers, and begin validating the Avalanche Primary Network with the required 2000 AVAX (earning both staking and GGP community rewards). Stakers receive the benefit of liquid staking, getting a wrapped ggAVAX token and having instant liquidity while earning rewards in real time. Over time, the hardware operators in our protocol grows. When a subnet launches, they join our protocol by staking the GGP token and in return get access to the protocol’s validator marketplace. Subnets receive validators right away, eliminating their biggest upfront cost. Liquid stakers and subnets work together to incentivize hardware operators, lowering the cost of launching subnets further.

Subnets are a flywheel for our protocol - they do our best acquisition for us for free by incentivizing hardware operators to join, and we provide them with a liquidity pool and node operators to validate their subnet in exchange. This network effect at scale trivializes the cost of growing subnets for entrepreneurs, and leads to GoGoPool powering the explosive growth of Avalanche.
