## What is GoGoPool?

GoGoPool is the first permissionless staking protocol built exclusively for [Avalanche Subnets](https://docs.avax.network/subnets)! Currently, we cater to node operators and liquid stakers.

### With GoGoPool, a node operator can:

* Launch their node for 1000 AVAX + 100 AVAX in GGP tokens, nearly half the price of the traditional avenue!
* Earn extra rewards using the GGP token and commission fees from liquid stakers
* Launch their node with just a few clicks

### For liquid stakers, we offer:

* Affordable staking for everyone for as little as .01 AVAX
* Staking with a validator pool to reduce loss risks from slashing and provide instant liquidity
* Join from an API-integrated business, deposit AVAX into a pool, and receive ggAVAX tokens that earn you rewards
